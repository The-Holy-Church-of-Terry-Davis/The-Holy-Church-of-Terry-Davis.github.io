      "content": "Hello all, it is currently 5:08am. I have spent too long making this tool. Anyways, Admins now have a blog creation tool at their disposal. It is 100x easier than manually writing in the `posts.json` file. This tool is effect of manifesting my inner broke mentality. Instead of paying for hosting, or a DB, or any of that fancy (proper) shit... The <a href=\"https://discord.gg/xEFtNzEzE8\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a> bot pushes a file change (posts.json) to the repo. Then whenever you load the site, JS looks in that file and renders the posts. It is now 5:12am. I can't English. Good night.. or Good morning? idk. piss off..."

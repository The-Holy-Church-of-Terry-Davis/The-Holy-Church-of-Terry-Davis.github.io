It is 100x easier than manually writing in the `posts.json` file. This tool is effect of manifesting my inner broke mentality. Instead of paying for hosting, or a DB, or any of that fancy (proper) shit... The <a href=\"https://discord.gg/xEFtNzEzE8\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a> bot pushes a file change (posts.json) to the repo. Then whenever you load the site, JS looks in that file and renders the posts. It is now 5:12am. I can't English. Good night.. or Good morning? idk. piss off..."

It's publicly available at <code>/admin</code>. However, only Admins can post as it requires a GitHub Personal Access Token that has write privilege to the site's <a href=\"https://github.com/The-Holy-Church-of-Terry-Davis/The-Holy-Church-of-Terry-Davis.github.io\" target=\"_blank\">repo</a>.<br/>\nNo Admin's token is logged nor stored. You can attempt to create a post, but if the access token is wrong/doesn't have write access, GitHub's API will throw an error. The JS is located at <code>/js/createpost.js</code>.<br/>\nHere are the available endpoints for admins (*coming soonâ„¢):\n<pre>\n<code>\n  /admin/createpost\n  /admin/editpost\n */admin/removepost\n</code>\n</pre>\n\nRandom ass post, that's all.\n"
